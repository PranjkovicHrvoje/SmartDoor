# SmartDoor

A simple smart door project based on Arduino and Python.
Arduino code is implemented on an Arduino Uno board. Python code for a Tornado server and SQL server runs on a Raspberry Pi. Communication between those two component is achieved using serial communication.

Project uses RFID cards to open the door from the outside and a motion sensor from the inside. 
Web clients can also connect to the Tornado server and control the door using a web app.
